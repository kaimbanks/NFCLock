# NFCLock

This is the repository for Kai Banks and Nikki Wines' NFC Door Lock project for ESE 205. 

Important to know: 
* the smartlock.ino file runs on the Particle Photon.
* the CADFiles directory contains the .stl files we used for the enclosure (credit to timpworx: https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:852169/#files)
